Creating OSX installer
----------------------
These instructions are in finished. The gist of it is that you want to install Node.JS, install node-appdmg, and then run the following command after you've command in the src/ directory after you've compiled Mudlet for OSX:

  ./mac-deploy.sh
  appdmg ./osx-installer/mudlet-appdmg.json ~/Desktop/Mudlet.dmg

This will give you a nice .dmg, with an aesthetic background and working icons you can drag to install.
