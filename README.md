# Mudlet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mudlet/Mudlet.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Mudlet/Mudlet)

Mudlet is a quality MUD client, designed to take mudding to a new level.

It’s a new breed of a client on the MUD scene – with an intuitive user interface, a specially designed scripting framework, and a very fast text display. Add to that cross-platform capability, an open-source development model, and you have a very likable MUD client.

## Easy to use client

We’re big on usability, and as such, creating an easy to use client and interface is one of the defining goals of the project. This applies to both the power users and plain gamers – everyone will feel at home with Mudlet, without having to waste too much time figuring out how to do something. Comments on display improvement are always welcome, and we’ll continue refining the design to perfection continually.

## Designed for speed

Mudlet is designed to be very fast and efficient right from the start, and we’re building it to be so. It’s scripting engine is designed to scale to large systems without bogging down – and the text display is designed to handle thousands of lines under a second. All in all, we are very serious about Mudlet being quick – and take all chances to make it so.

## Powerful Scripting

Mudlet will feature a scripting framework featuring Lua – a small, fast and efficient scripting language. While this certainly isn’t exactly a new innovation, at least we won’t be taking a step back by creating a home-made scripting language. Lua API doesn’t make use of pre-processing or necessitate a variable server either; the scripting context is shared by all aliases, triggers, scripts, keybindings, buttons and etc.

## Cross-Platform love

We believe in making Mudlet available to people on all major platforms, and we work on keeping cross-platform compatibility right from start. Mudlet will be available on Linux (both 32bit and 64bit), Windows, and Macs.

## And many other things…

Such as package creation / sharing, 3D mapper are in our plans. You’re welcome to suggest ideas, too!
